# Third person gameplay prototype

A third person gameplay prototype on Unreal Engine where I try to experiment with the gameplay 3C (Controls, Character, Camera).

## TODO
- target lock with straffing (face the target while locked)
- guard and parry system
- dodge
- health bar and UI
- collectables (chests)
