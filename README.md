# Third person gameplay prototype

A third person gameplay prototype on Unreal Engine wher I try to experiment with the gameplay 3C (Controls, Character, Camera).

## TODO
- freeze rotation when attacking
- implement enemies
- target lock with straffing (face the target while locked)
- guard and parry system
